Covenant's Ideas:
1. App that forces you to break down a project step by step in order to help manage its completion
2. An application that randomly matches you with a a volunteering event happenning in your community. Maybe 'party feature' to ensure being matched at same event with friends/family
3. Quacs Feature: Enter what requirements one still needs to fulfill to graduate and Quacs uses that to recommend classes for the following semester. Recommendations can further be filtered with 'preferences'
