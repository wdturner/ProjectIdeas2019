# Simple Calendar/Task Managing program (Nick Yao)
I'm usually really disorganized when it comes to keeping track of
homeworks/exams, so I think it'd be a good idea to develop a lightweight task
app (hopefully with an Android/iOS widget for easy access). Something to help
centralize important tasks and maybe even have a priority system.

# RateMyProfessors for Landlords in Troy (Serena Chen)
On the RPI subreddit, there was a post about having an app similar to 
RateMyProfesssors but for landlords in the Troy area. The student(s) who 
made this post have already been working on this project, but as of now, it's
not out for the public yet, and I don't think it's open source (I couldn't
find any source code). I think it would be cool to make this an open source 
app, as it is something many RPI students would be interested in.

# Online Multiplayer Browser Game (Mack Qian)
I'm interested in doing something web related as I have no experience in it at all. I think a simple multiplayer game might be something cool to do, though it might be a nightmare trying to deal with concurrency and syncing issues, so I might want to try to make some sort of 1v1 turn based game or something. Maybe a board game like chess? Or something new?

# Browser based programming workspace
I'm thinking of making a browser based IDE (with sudo shell access) that connects to a persistant VM instance that you can access at any time. What this allows you to do is do all your development work online and access it from anywhere. One advantage of this over things like CodeSandbox and StackBlitz is that it will allow you complete shell access, and therefore let you do things like set up Docker, databases, or literally anything. Special care would have to be made to ensure all VMs are sandboxed from eachother
