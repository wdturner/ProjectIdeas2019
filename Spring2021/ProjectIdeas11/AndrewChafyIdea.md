I want to make an autoscheduler that will help people who suffer from time blindness better manage their time. In theory this would mainly be an algorithm that searched for free time 
within a calendar and spaced out tasks from a to do list to the calendar auto scheduling them. This will allow people to better manage their free time with less hassle.
