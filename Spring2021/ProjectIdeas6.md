A web or desktop application that, given data on a natural disaster, will determine safe evacuation routes for affected communities.

Trevor's idea is for a site or program with which you can keep track of what ingredients you have laying around and what recipes you know how to make. The software would then show you which recipes you know that you have the ingredients for. Recipes could also be shared, and there could be a feature to help generate shopping lists based on what you want to make.

I was considering doing data analytics for games, along the lines of player gameplay optimization and helping players focus on what to improve through data.

Abdul's Idea: Create an AI that can read minds.

Christine's Idea: A tinder-like app that users can create profiles on and then swipe on different movies and tv shows. The idea is that after enough swiping, your profile is linked to a database of entertainment that you've tagged as like or dislike. Then, when you want to watch tv with someone else, you can compare databases with your friends and quickly learn what entertainment you have in common. It could even be taken a step further, and be filtered by genre, length, language, rating, etc.

Kevin: I think having a personal website that can speak for itself in terms of skills would be cool. By that I mean I think I would like to construct my own personal website with resources like React. On the actual website I would plan to explain some of the projects I've worked on inside/outside school. To allow this project to be used by others, I think templating the project in another git branch could be helpful, so people could use a blank slate.
